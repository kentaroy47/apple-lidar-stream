# ipad-lidar-stream
Stream Apple lidar data (e.g. iPad Pro) with open3d.

Please leave a star if this helps you!

Uses [record3d](https://github.com/marek-simonik/record3d) to stream lidar data, and visualizes point clouds by open3d.

Can integrate denoising functions of open3d as well.

Enjoy!

## requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python ipad_stream.py`

## Devices
~~Since I have only iPad Pro, I cannot test this on iPhone 12Pro or 13Pro.~~

Thanks to [#2](https://github.com/kentaroy47/apple-lidar-stream/pull/2), it works on iPhone LiDARs too.
